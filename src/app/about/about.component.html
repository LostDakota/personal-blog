  About me
</h2>
<p>My name is Drew Mika. I hail from a suburb of Youngstown, Ohio.
  <br/>
  That sound amazing, you say! 
  It sure is! 
  Youngstown used to have quite a lot to offer, but over the last, oh I don't know 30-40 something years, it's not been doing so hot.
  <br/>
  I graduated from the Youngstown State University in 2006 with a bachelor's in graphic design.
  How did I get into application development, you might ask.
  Well, let me tell you a story, as my mom would say.
  <br/>
  My glorious first generation iMac broke (corrupted os) around the time of graduation and I wasn't able to shell out the money for a new machine and I lost the disc to do a reinstall.
  So I took to the internet for a solution.
  I found Linux! 
  I know, I know. WTF? No one cares about that, but it's important to the story.
  I installed Ubuntu and realized that there was a whole new world out there that I wasn't privy to.
  <br/>
  In high school, and college, I learned html and css.
  There was also image slicing and Dreamweaver, ugh.
  But I never learned any other higher level programming languages.
  Enter bash (not a real language) and php...
  We all have to start somewhere.
  <br/>
  I started writing a site for home automation.
  Nothing fancy, really.
  Just something I could check in on the various cameras I had set up around the house and open the garage door with a raspberry pi.
  NBD.
  I kept at it and then I had a relatively polished website.
  With ajax and haptic feedback and responsivness, oh my.
  <br/>
  I took my shiny website (then webapp) and applied as a Developer I at Hyland Software a couple of years ago.
  Never in a million years would I have thought I could land that type of gig.
  I did.
  So cool.
  I love my job.
  I'll write a blog post about what we're working on at a later date.
  <br/>
  Anyway.
  This is what I do now full time.
  My passion is javascript and node, but I make the donuts with C#. 
  I love learning new things and I don't ever want to stop.
  <br/>
  Thanks for visiting my site!
